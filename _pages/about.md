I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign advised by Professor [ChengXiang Zhai](https://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I am interested in applying natural language processing and information retrieval techniques to information organization, especially for organizing text collections as graphs.
