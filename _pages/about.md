I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign advised by professor [ChengXiang Zhai](https://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I am intrested in applying natural language processing and information retreival techniques to information organization, especially for organizing text collections as graphs.
