I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign advised by Professor [ChengXiang Zhai](https://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). My research centers on **Information Organization and Access**. More specifically, I have focused on using ML, NLP, and IR techniques to transform unstructured text collections into meaningful graphical structures. My recent work has focused on the Hypergraph of Text data structure. 

<!-- ## Research Vision

I believe that the future of information access lies in **structured understanding** rather than just keyword matching. When we can represent the collective knowledge of humanity as an interconnected graph, we unlock new possibilities for:

- **Education**: Personalized learning paths through knowledge networks
- **Research**: Accelerated discovery through intelligent literature navigation
- **Decision Making**: Better insights through comprehensive information synthesis -->
